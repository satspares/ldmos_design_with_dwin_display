Work in progress! since 2021

LDMOS control software and PCB design for dxworld - QRPblog A600 - or similar amps using DWIN display.

PCB design used Kicad.

Software vscode and platformio.

From the DWIN store on aliexpress
DMG10600C070_03WTC 7inch  1024x600

DMG10600T070_A5WTC 1024x600 more expensive has case and rs232

DMG80480C050_04W 5inch we need touch version DMG80480C050_04WTC  800x480

DMG80480T050_A5W more cost has case speaker and rs232

DMG80480C043_02W 4.3 inch 800x480 I have this one a bit small for big fingers.

The WTC at the end of the part number is capacitive touch or WTR is resistive touch both are ok but the WTC versions are more sensitive.
Obviously make sure you get a touch version!
Caution some of the displays have a solder link to move from rs232 to ttl.


Some of the later work here is from the excellent ideas of S21RC

On the PCB the potentiometers are for testing purposes only and need not be fitted.
